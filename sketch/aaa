Okay, I understand. You've provided the gemini_voltsens.c code, and you want a clear, step-by-step guide on how to perform the calibration for the voltage sensors used in this code. You want to know the practical "how-to" of the calibration process.

Let's break down the calibration process into manageable steps.

Calibration: A Step-by-Step Guide

Goal: Determine the correct dcLoad_VoltageSlope, dcLoad_VoltageIntercept, dcArduino_VoltageSlope, and dcArduino_VoltageIntercept values for your specific voltage sensors.

Equipment Needed:

Multimeter: A digital multimeter (DMM) is essential for accurately measuring the actual voltages.
Variable Power Supply (Recommended): A variable DC power supply allows you to easily set different known voltages. If you don't have one, you can use a set of batteries with known voltages, but it's less convenient.
Arduino Board: Your Arduino board (e.g., Uno) with the gemini_voltsens.c code uploaded.
Voltage Sensor Modules: The two voltage sensor modules you're using (one for DC Load, one for DC Arduino).
Connecting Wires: Jumper wires to connect everything.
Computer with Arduino IDE: To upload the code and monitor the serial output.
Bluetooth serial monitor: To send the commands to the arduino.
Procedure:

Phase 1: Preparing the Code for Calibration

Modify the Code for Serial Output:

We need to temporarily modify the gemini_voltsens.c code to print the raw ADC readings to the serial monitor (or Bluetooth). This will allow us to see the dcLoad_sensorValue and dcArduino_sensorValue values.
Add the following lines to the code, inside the loop() function, after the voltage calculations:
 c 
// ... (inside the loop() function) ...

// DC Load Voltage Measurement
int dcLoad_sensorValue = analogRead(dcLoad_sensorPin);
float dcLoad_voltage = (dcLoad_sensorValue * dcLoad_VoltageSlope) + dcLoad_VoltageIntercept;  // Calibrated voltage
BTSerial.print("Load Voltage: ");
BTSerial.print(dcLoad_voltage);
BTSerial.print(" Load ADC: "); // Add this line
BTSerial.println(dcLoad_sensorValue); // Add this line

// DC Arduino Voltage Measurement
int dcArduino_sensorValue = analogRead(dcArduino_sensorPin);
float dcArduino_voltage = (dcArduino_sensorValue * dcArduino_VoltageSlope) + dcArduino_VoltageIntercept;
BTSerial.print("Arduino Voltage: ");
BTSerial.print(dcArduino_voltage);
BTSerial.print(" Arduino ADC: "); // Add this line
BTSerial.println(dcArduino_sensorValue); // Add this line

// ... (rest of the loop() function) ...
These lines will print the calculated voltage, and the raw ADC reading.
Upload the Modified Code:

Upload the modified gemini_voltsens.c code to your Arduino.
Phase 2: Collecting Calibration Data (Sensor by Sensor)

Repeat the following steps for BOTH the DC Load sensor AND the DC Arduino sensor.

Connect the Sensor:
Connect the output of the voltage sensor module to the appropriate analog pin on the Arduino:
DC Load Sensor: Connect to dcLoad_sensorPin (A0).
DC Arduino Sensor: Connect to dcArduino_sensorPin (A1).
Connect the input of the voltage sensor module to your variable power supply (or battery).
Connect your multimeter in parallel with the voltage sensor's input. This means the multimeter's positive probe goes to the positive input of the sensor, and the multimeter's negative probe goes to the negative input of the sensor.
Set the Power Supply:
Turn on your variable power supply.
Set the power supply to a known voltage. Start with a low voltage, like 0.5V.
Important: Use your multimeter to verify the actual voltage at the sensor's input. Don't just rely on the power supply's display.
Record the Data:
Open the serial monitor or bluetooth serial monitor in the Arduino IDE.
Observe the output. You'll see lines like:
 plaintext 
Load Voltage: 0.012 Load ADC: 5
Arduino Voltage: 0.012 Arduino ADC: 5
Create a table (like the ones we discussed before) to record your data.
Record the following:
Known Voltage (V): The voltage you measured with the multimeter.
ADC Reading (0-1023): The dcLoad_sensorValue or dcArduino_sensorValue from the serial monitor.
Repeat for Multiple Voltages:
Increase the power supply voltage to a new known value (e.g., 1.0V, 1.5V, 2.0V, 2.5V, 3.0V, 3.5V, 4.0V, 4.5V, 5.0V, etc.).
Each time, use the multimeter to verify the voltage.
Record the known voltage and the corresponding ADC reading in your table.
Repeat this process until you have at least 5-10 data points, spread out over the voltage range you expect to measure (up to 25V).
Repeat for the other sensor:
Repeat the process for the other sensor.
Phase 3: Analyzing the Data and Calculating Slope/Intercept

Data Entry:
Enter your data from the tables into a spreadsheet program (like Excel or Google Sheets).
You should have two sets of data: one for the DC Load sensor and one for the DC Arduino sensor.
Create Scatter Plots:
For each sensor's data, create a scatter plot:
X-axis: ADC Reading (0-1023)
Y-axis: Known Voltage (V)
This will visually show the relationship between the ADC reading and the actual voltage.
Linear Regression:
Use the spreadsheet program's linear regression feature (or a data analysis tool) to find the best-fit line for each scatter plot.
In Excel or Google Sheets, you can do this by:
Selecting your data.
Inserting a scatter plot.
Right-clicking on the data points and choosing "Add Trendline."
Selecting "Linear" as the trendline type.
Checking the boxes for "Display Equation on chart" and "Display R-squared value on chart."
The equation of the line will be in the form y = mx + b, where:
y is the actual voltage.
x is the ADC reading.
m is the slope.
b is the y-intercept.
Record Slope and Intercept:
For each sensor, record the slope (m) and intercept (b) values from the linear regression equation.
These are your calibration values.
Phase 4: Updating the Code with Calibration Values

Replace Placeholders:

In your gemini_voltsens.c code, replace the placeholder slope and intercept values with the values you calculated:
 c 
// Calibration values (replace with your actual calibration data)
float dcLoad_VoltageSlope = <your_dcLoad_slope_value>;  // Replace this
float dcLoad_VoltageIntercept = <your_dcLoad_intercept_value>;  // Replace this

float dcArduino_VoltageSlope = <your_dcArduino_slope_value>;  // Replace this
float dcArduino_VoltageIntercept = <your_dcArduino_intercept_value>;  // Replace this
Remove Calibration Code:

Remove the lines added to print the ADC values.
Upload the Final Code:

Upload the updated gemini_voltsens.c code to your Arduino.
Phase 5: Testing and Verification

Test with Known Voltages:
Connect your sensors to known voltages (using your power supply and multimeter).
Observe the voltage readings in the serial monitor.
Verify that the readings are now accurate.
Test with Fluctuating Voltages:
If you have a way to create fluctuating voltages, test the sensor's accuracy under those conditions.
Important Notes:

Accuracy: The accuracy of your calibration depends on the accuracy of your multimeter and the precision of your measurements.
Multiple Measurements: Take multiple measurements at each voltage to improve accuracy.
Spread Out Data Points: Spread your data points evenly across the voltage range.
Repeat if Necessary: If you're not satisfied with the accuracy, repeat the calibration process.
By following these steps, you'll be able to accurately calibrate your voltage sensors and get reliable voltage readings from your Arduino. Let me know if you have any more questions!
